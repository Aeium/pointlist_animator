Hello, welcome to pointlist_animator, this is a tool to help take lists of numbers and turn them into animations

Example:

![animation](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OddballArtisticKestrel-size_restricted.gif)

This tool will make the frames (.png files) but you will need another tool to create a compressed video


Quickstart:

pip install pillow

pip install numpy

git clone https://github.com/Aeium/pointlist_animator

cd pointlist_animator

mkdir output1

mkdir output2

python useage_example.py
